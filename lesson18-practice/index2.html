    <h1 class="primary-title">Brendan Eich</h1>
    <p>
      Brendan Eichis an American computer programmer and technology executive.
      He created the JavaScript programming language and co-founded the Mozilla
      project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation. He served as
      the Mozilla Corporation's chief technical officer before he was appointed
      chief executive officer, but resigned shortly after his appointment due to
      pressure over his firm opposition to same-sex marriage. He subsequently
      became the cofounder and CEO of Brave Software.
