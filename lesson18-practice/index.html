            Brendan Eichis an American computer programmer and technology
            executive. He created the JavaScript programming language and
            co-founded the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the
            Mozilla Corporation. He served as the Mozilla Corporation's chief
            technical officer before he was appointed chief executive officer,
            but resigned shortly after his appointment due to pressure over his
            firm opposition to same-sex marriage. He subsequently became the
            cofounder and CEO of Brave Software.
